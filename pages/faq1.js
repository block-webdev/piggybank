                            <p>
                                “HODL” is a term that is often used in the Bitcoin investment community. “Hodling” refers to the buy-and-hold strategy. Buy-and-hold investors tend to hold their assets for an extended period of time to profit from the long-term value appreciation. The “hodling” strategy helps investors avoid realizing loss from the short-term volatility of cryptocurrencies and gain returns from long-term value appreciation.

Our investment strategy is straightforward and proven. but attacks can happen and hackers are always trying to intrude in weak points. We are well equipped to withstand such threats but the danger is there and should be communicated.
                                Some cryptocurrencies can loose value quicker than new coins are generated. we are very selective and with experience you learn what coins are worth holding and which are not. Lastly since this has never been done in the history there could be unforeseen circumstances happening and laws made that would prevent us from doing what we do (Force majeure).

                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                Also known as "eighth wonder of the world" by Albert Einstein, compound interest is not always understood, but crucially important. Nowhere less so than in the protection of your hard-earned money. When comparing investment returns of stocks, bonds, bank deposits, real estate, gold, or cryptocurrency, you must compare them not by the gross return, but by the compound return. Compounding allows your deposit to grow very fast. In cryptopiggybank Each Deposit is locked for 12 months minimum (This applies also for every compounded amount as it’s counted as a deposit in itself).
                                You can choose how much you like to compound with locked staking. It is entirely up to you. Some like to withdraw all earnings, some compound upwards for a while and withdraw then, Its your money so you decide!
